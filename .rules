# Writing style

## Formatting

* Use Semantic Line Breaks, but don't be too aggressive adding link breaks
* No newline at the beginning of file
* Markdown headings should have newlines around them
* Lists: newlines before first item and after last item
* Use `*` for all list markers (not `-`)
* List item continuation lines should have 2-space indentation

## Confidentiality

* Use `$WORK` placeholder for company/employer
* No internal project names, codenames, customer or partner details
* Keep metrics and technical details generic
