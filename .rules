# Writing style

## Formatting

* Use Semantic Line Breaks, but don't be too aggressive adding link breaks
* No newline at the beginning of file
* Markdown headings should have newlines around them
* Lists: newlines before first item and after last item
* Use `*` for all list markers (not `-`)
* List item continuation lines should have 2-space indentation

## Confidentiality

* Use `$WORK` placeholder for company/employer
* No internal project names, codenames, customer or partner details
* Keep metrics and technical details generic

## Narrative Style

* Lead with outcomes: "Unblocked stabilization" not "Advanced system"
* Use outcome-focused verbs: Stabilized, Enabled, Fixed, Unblocked
* Avoid process verbs as opening: Reviewed, Discussed, Worked on
* Explain WHO benefits, WHAT it enables, WHY it matters
* Connect to bigger initiatives: Rust Project Goals, RFCs, ecosystem needs
