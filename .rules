# Writing style

## Formatting

* Use Semantic Line Breaks, but don't be too aggressive adding link breaks
* No newline at the beginning of file
* Markdown headings should have newlines around them
* Lists: newlines before first item and after last item
* Use `*` for all list markers (not `-`)
* List item continuation lines should have 2-space indentation

## Confidentiality

* Use `$WORK` placeholder for company/employer
* No internal project names, codenames, customer or partner details
* Keep metrics and technical details generic

## Monthly summaries

### Structure

* Aggregate weekly entries by theme, not chronologically
* Group related activities into single bullet points (e.g., all cache management work together)
* One clear theme per bullet - split unrelated work even if from same week
* Combine multiple PRs/discussions under broader goals

### Lead with outcomes

* Start with impact, not process - "Unblocked stabilization" not "Advanced system"
* Use outcome-focused verbs: Stabilized, Enabled, Fixed, Unblocked
* Avoid process verbs as opening: Reviewed, Discussed, Worked on (okay for supporting context)
* Explain what it enables first, then how if needed

### Explain impact

* Who benefits: $WORK, enterprise users, specific communities, tool maintainers
* What it enables: parallel builds, stabilization paths, better observability
* Why it matters: solves pain points, addresses blockers, improves security
* Connect to bigger initiatives: Rust Project Goals, RFCs, ecosystem needs

### Clarity

* Clarify your role: champion vs implementor, reviewer vs author
* Include context links: design docs, Project Goal pages, not just PRs
* Be specific about scope: "one step toward stabilization", "beta backport"
* Combine discovered work with its source (e.g., optimizations found during feature work)

### What to avoid

* Don't lead with process verbs - buries the impact
* Don't list PRs chronologically - group by what they accomplish
* Don't include minor/unthematic items unless they fit a broader theme
* Don't focus on HOW over WHAT and WHY

### When in doubt

* If missing context, ask the user
* Look at previous months for style consistency
