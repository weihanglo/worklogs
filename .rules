# Writing style

## Formatting

* Use Semantic Line Breaks, but don't be too aggressive adding link breaks
* No newline at the beginning of file
* Markdown headings should have newlines around them
* Lists: newlines before first item and after last item
* Use `*` for all list markers (not `-`)
* List item continuation lines should have 2-space indentation

## Confidentiality

* Use `$WORK` placeholder for company/employer
* No internal project names, codenames, customer or partner details
* Keep metrics and technical details generic

## Monthly summaries

* Aggregate weekly entries by theme, not chronologically
* Group related activities into single bullet points
* Lead with outcomes and impact, not process details
* Combine multiple PRs/discussions under broader goals
* Be concise: focus on what was accomplished and why it matters
* If missing context, ask the user
